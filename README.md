<hr/>

There are many variations of checkers, the most popular of them are checkers for two. <br/>
You've ever gotten into a situation where your third friend is forced to wait until you <br/>
finish the intellectual batl with a second in the checkers party. <br/>
So, now the third is NOT superfluous =))). 

### In general, the rules are reminiscent of all of us known checkers for two, but with their features:

•	Each player has 12 checkers. <br/>
•	You can move in any direction, moving only in black triangles <br/>
•	You can only beat one checker at a time. <br/>
•	The player wins only if there are no checkers from the other two players <br/>

### We hope that our game will help you have fun in the company of 3 friends. Have fun :)
